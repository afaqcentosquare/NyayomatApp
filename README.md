# Nyayomat-ACP-Mobile-App

Project Overview

Nyayomat ACP (Nyayomat Boost) is built alongside an e-commerce platform whereby merchants are connected to partners (Asset Providers) through the ACP. The platform acts as an intermediary between micro, small and medium-sized merchants and asset providers to facilitate asset/working capital financing between the counterparties.

The Mobile application available in android and ios versions is used by merchants as an alternative avenue to interact with the platform.
